# Exposing this MCP server as a network-addressable Bindu agent

This directory contains a complete, working example of how to take the
open-source `mcp-taiwan-legal-db` (lawchat-oss) Model Context Protocol
server and expose it as a network-addressable A2A agent using
[Bindu](https://github.com/GetBindu/Bindu).

> **Community-built example.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by the
> `lawchat-oss` maintainers, any Taiwan government body, or any law firm.
> The MCP server is open source under its own LICENSE; this directory
> is example glue for one possible way to drive it.

It is contributed by the team at **Bindu**, where we are building a
**compliance operating system for small and medium businesses**. The
agent in this directory ("Lex Taiwan") is one of the reference agents
we ship as part of that work, and the present pull request is the
result of integrating the `mcp-taiwan-legal-db` MCP server into our
compliance stack. We link back to this repository from Bindu's
documentation as a technical reference — the canonical way to reach
Taiwan's public legal corpora over MCP.

## Maintenance

The upstream MCP server in `mcp_server/` is maintained by the
`lawchat-oss` team — please file issues there for anything to do with
the tools or the underlying data.

For questions, bugs, or improvements specific to *this example* — the
Bindu glue (`bindu_agent.py`, `cli.py`), the system prompt
(`prompts.py`), or this README — please open an issue against
[Bindu](https://github.com/GetBindu/Bindu) and tag the title with
`[mcp-taiwan-legal-db example]`, or reach the Bindu team on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/3w5zuYUuwt). We will keep this
directory in sync with the upstream MCP server's tool surface.

## What the example does

A program written against this example can ask Taiwan legal questions in
plain Chinese or English over a standard HTTP endpoint and receive
answers that are grounded entirely in the eight tools your MCP server
exposes — with citations to the underlying judgments, regulations, and
constitutional interpretations. The agent is given a structured system
prompt that requires it to call your tools rather than rely on the
language model's training memory, and to cite each statement against the
primary source it came from.

The agent uses two open-source libraries:

- **Bindu** — the framework we are building. It turns a Python function
  into a network-addressable agent with its own cryptographic identity
  (a Decentralized Identifier, or DID) and a public agent card,
  reachable over the Agent-to-Agent JSON-RPC protocol defined at
  https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A.
- **agno** — used as the internal agent loop. It handles the
  language-model API call, the tool-calling protocol, and short-term
  conversation memory.

The MCP server itself comes from this repository, unmodified. It is
launched as a child process and the agent communicates with it over
standard input and output, as defined by the Model Context Protocol.

## Setup

The example reuses your repository's own virtual environment. The MCP
server is launched directly from the local `mcp_server` package, so no
separate installation of `mcp-taiwan-legal-db` from PyPI is required.

From the root of this repository, run:

```bash
# 1. Complete the upstream "Development setup" first, if you haven't.
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/pip install -e .

# 2. Install the additional packages this example needs.
.venv/bin/pip install -r examples/agno-bindu/requirements.txt

# 3. Provide a language-model API key.
cp examples/agno-bindu/.env.example examples/agno-bindu/.env
# Open the .env file and set OPENROUTER_API_KEY to your key
# from https://openrouter.ai/keys
```

The default model is `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, selected because it
performs well on both tool use and Traditional Chinese. You can switch
the model by setting `BINDU_AGENT_MODEL` in the `.env` file to any
identifier supported by OpenRouter — for example `openai/gpt-4o`,
`google/gemini-2.5-pro`, or `deepseek/deepseek-chat`.

---

## Network exposure & dependencies

This section flags three things that are easy to miss when running the
example for the first time. Read it before you change the defaults.

### Public network exposure is opt-in

Bindu can open an [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) reverse tunnel
that makes the agent's HTTP endpoint reachable on the public internet.
That is useful for cross-network agent-to-agent calls, but it has two
properties worth being explicit about:

- The HTTP endpoint at `:3773` is **unauthenticated** at the transport
  layer. Anyone who learns the FRP URL can hit `message/send`.
- Each request runs through your configured LLM (OpenRouter or
  whichever provider you set), so **your model-API key is on the
  billing path** for any caller who reaches the agent.

Because of this, `bindu_agent.py` sets `expose` from a `BINDU_EXPOSE`
env var and **defaults it to `false`**. Local development on
`http://localhost:3773` works without changing anything. To enable the
FRP tunnel, set `BINDU_EXPOSE=true` in `.env` deliberately, and review
the rest of this section first.

### `BINDU_AGENT_AUTHOR` ends up in the public DID

Once the tunnel is on, the agent's DID — visible in every agent card
fetch and embedded in every signed artifact — has the shape
`did:bindu:<author>:<name>:<uuid>`, with `<author>` derived from
whatever you set in `BINDU_AGENT_AUTHOR`. The example default in both
`.env.example` and the agent card snippet above is the literal
placeholder `your_email_here@example.com`, so you will notice
immediately if you forgot to substitute your own value before turning
on `BINDU_EXPOSE`.

### Dependency breadth

The `bindu` package on PyPI pulls a wider dependency tree than the
example actually exercises, because Bindu integrates with several
optional infrastructure layers and ships their clients in the core
distribution. As of this PR, that includes (non-exhaustive):

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces and metrics.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) error reporting (off unless a DSN is
  set).
- An [Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) OAuth2 client (off unless
  Hydra URLs are set).
- An [x402](https://x402.io/) / USDC micropayment client (off unless a
  wallet is configured).

Each of those features is **opt-in** via environment variables — none
of them is engaged in this example. But the libraries themselves are
installed into your virtual environment when you run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, regardless of whether you use them.
If you prefer a narrower footprint, you can run the example against
the `cli.py` entry point instead, which exercises the agno + MCP path
without Bindu in the loop.

---

## Running the agent

The primary entry point is the Bindu A2A service:

```bash
.venv/bin/python examples/agno-bindu/bindu_agent.py
```

This starts a network-addressable agent on port 3773. The MCP server is
started once when the program loads and is kept running across all
subsequent requests, which avoids the cost of restarting it for every
question. The endpoints the service exposes are documented in the API
reference below.

For quick local checks without spinning up the network service, you can
also use the command-line script. It opens the MCP server, asks one
question, prints the cited answer, and exits:

```bash
.venv/bin/python examples/agno-bindu/cli.py "民法第 184 條的現行條文是什麼？"
.venv/bin/python examples/agno-bindu/cli.py "釋字 748 引用了哪些更早的釋字？"
.venv/bin/python examples/agno-bindu/cli.py \
  "Find Supreme Court cases about 借名登記 from 民國 113 onwards. Return only the case identifier and a one-line holding."
```

---

## API reference

The Bindu A2A service exposes the endpoints below at
`http://localhost:3773` by default. The shapes shown here apply to any
A2A deployment of this example.

### `GET /.well-known/agent.json`

Returns the agent's public agent card. The card describes who the agent
is, what it can do, and how to talk to it. Any A2A-aware client should
fetch this first.

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3773/.well-known/agent.json | jq
```

**Example response (abridged):**

```json
{
  "id": "44b10e18-be36-03c7-1941-6c393c32e5b8",
  "name": "bindu-lex-taiwan",
  "description": "An agentic Taiwan legal research assistant: judgments, regulations, and constitutional court interpretations, sourced from public 司法院, 全國法規資料庫, and 憲法法庭 databases.

  "url": "http://localhost:3773",
  "version": "2026.20.8",
  "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
  "kind": "agent",

        "uri": "did:bindu:your_email_here_at_example_com:bindu-lex-taiwan:44b10e18-be36-03c7-1941-6c393c32e5b8",

  "skills": [],
  "agentTrust": {
    "identityProvider": "custom",
    "trustVerificationRequired": false
  }
}
```

The `extensions[].uri` field contains the agent's Decentralized
Identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies this agent instance.

### `GET /health`

Returns a small JSON health-check payload. Useful for liveness probes.

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3773/health | jq
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "version": "2026.20.3",
  "health": "healthy",
  "runtime": {
    "storage_backend": "InMemoryStorage",
    "scheduler_backend": "InMemoryScheduler",
    "task_manager_running": true,
    "strict_ready": true
  },
  "application": {
    "penguin_id": "2d5b0908-4384-bb67-8c8c-3c2801999e96",
    "agent_did": "did:bindu:your_email_here_at_example_com:bindu-lex-taiwan:2d5b0908-4384-bb67-8c8c-3c2801999e96"
  },
  "system": {
    "python_version": "3.14.2",
    "platform": "Darwin",
    "environment": "development"
  },
  "status": "ok",
  "ready": true,
  "uptime_seconds": 12.3
}
```

The `application.agent_did` field is the same DID returned in the
agent card.

### `POST /` (JSON-RPC 2.0)

This is the main endpoint. It accepts JSON-RPC 2.0 requests. The two
methods this example supports are described below.

#### Method: `message/send`

Submits a new question to the agent. The agent runs asynchronously, so
this method does not return the final answer directly. It returns a
task object that includes a `taskId`. The client then polls
`tasks/get` until the task reaches a terminal state.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "<a UUID for this RPC call>",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "configuration": {
      "acceptedOutputModes": ["text/plain"]
    },
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "messageId": "<a UUID>",
      "contextId": "<a UUID identifying the conversation>",
      "taskId":    "<a UUID identifying the task>",
      "kind": "message",
      "parts": [
        { "kind": "text", "text": "釋字 748 解釋日期？一句話。" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

All four identifier fields (`id`, `messageId`, `contextId`, `taskId`)
must be valid UUIDs. The `contextId` should be reused across requests
that belong to the same conversation; a fresh `taskId` is used for each
new question.

**Example request (concrete UUIDs filled in):**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3773 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id":        "f3e6a1e2-1b3c-4ad5-8f5e-9c4ad5b3f3a1",
    "method":    "message/send",
    "params": {
      "configuration": { "acceptedOutputModes": ["text/plain"] },
      "message": {
        "role":      "user",
        "messageId": "8c1c2f9e-71b4-47e8-9a0b-3b6f9b6f1c2a",
        "contextId": "5b9b3c4d-22ef-4f10-87f8-2a1b9b8c7d6e",
        "taskId":    "7d9e1c2b-aaaa-4f00-bbbb-1234567890ab",
        "kind":      "message",
        "parts": [
          { "kind": "text", "text": "釋字 748 解釋日期？一句話。" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }' | jq
```

**Response body (the task has been accepted but is not finished yet):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "<echoes your request id>",
  "result": {
    "id": "<the taskId you sent, echoed back>",
    "contextId": "<the contextId you sent>",
    "status": { "state": "submitted" },
    "artifacts": [],
    "history": []
  }
}
```

#### Method: `tasks/get`

Fetches the current state of a previously submitted task. Clients
typically call this in a polling loop until the task reaches a terminal
state.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "<a fresh UUID for this RPC call>",
  "method": "tasks/get",
  "params": {
    "taskId": "<the taskId returned from message/send>"
  }
}
```

**Example request (using the `taskId` from the `message/send` example above):**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3773 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id":      "9e8d7c6b-5a4b-3c2d-1e0f-abcdef012345",
    "method":  "tasks/get",
    "params": {
      "taskId": "7d9e1c2b-aaaa-4f00-bbbb-1234567890ab"
    }
  }' | jq
```

**Response body when the task is finished:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "<echoes your request id>",
  "result": {
    "id": "<the taskId>",
    "contextId": "<the contextId>",
    "status": { "state": "completed" },
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "artifactId": "<a UUID>",
        "parts": [
          {
            "kind": "text",
            "text": "司法院釋字第 748 號於民國 106 年 5 月 24 日作成。\n\n### Sources\n- 司法院釋字第 748 號【同性二人婚姻自由案】(106-05-24) https://cons.judicial.gov.tw/docdata.aspx?fid=100&id=310929&rn=8467"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `status.state` field can take any of the following values:

| State              | Meaning                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `submitted`        | The request was accepted; processing has not started yet.     |
| `working`          | The agent is processing the request.                          |
| `input-required`   | The agent needs clarification before it can continue.         |
| `completed`        | The agent has finished; the answer is in `artifacts`.         |
| `failed`           | The agent could not complete the request.                     |

#### Error responses

JSON-RPC errors follow the standard JSON-RPC 2.0 shape:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": null,
  "error": {
    "code": -32700,
    "message": "Failed to parse JSON payload. Please ensure the request body contains valid JSON syntax.",
    "data": "<the underlying validation error, when applicable>"
  }
}
```

### A worked end-to-end example

The shell snippet below sends one question and prints the final answer.

```bash
# Generate the four UUIDs the A2A spec requires.

      \"params\":{\"taskId\":\"$TASK_ID\"}
    }")
  STATE=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.result.status.state // "?"')
  echo "state: $STATE"
  case "$STATE" in
    completed|failed|input-required)
      echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.result.artifacts[0].parts[0].text'
      break
      ;;
  esac
  sleep 2
done
```

### The eight MCP tools

For completeness, the agent has access to the eight tools your server
exposes: `search_judgments`, `get_judgment`, `query_regulation`,
`get_pcode`, `search_regulations`, `get_interpretation`,
`search_interpretations`, and `get_citations`. The agent selects among
them automatically based on the question. The authoritative reference
for each tool is your top-level README's "What you get / Tool details"
section.

---

## How the agent is instructed

The system prompt (`prompts.py`) is the part of the example that turns a
general-purpose language model into a Taiwan legal research assistant.
It is broken into labelled sections so each rule the agent must follow is
unambiguous, and it pins the agent to four behaviours:

1. **Every answer must come from your MCP server.** The agent is
   instructed never to answer from training memory when the question
   touches a Taiwan statute, judgment, or constitutional interpretation.
2. **The agent must cite every claim.** Judgments are cited by their
   case identifier (`JID`), regulations by their name and article
   number, and constitutional interpretations by their number and
   issuance date.
3. **The agent prefers the cheapest precise call.** When a regulation
   name is known, it resolves the `pcode` first and then fetches the
   article, rather than running a keyword search. When a case identifier
   is known, it uses `search_judgments(case_word, case_number,
   year_from)` instead of stuffing the identifier into the `keyword`
   field.
4. **The agent declines questions outside Taiwan's jurisdiction** and
   asks for clarification when the question is genuinely ambiguous,
   instead of guessing.

## Verified end-to-end

The following queries were executed against the real MCP server, hitting
`law.moj.gov.tw`, `judgment.judicial.gov.tw`, and
`cons.judicial.gov.tw`, during integration testing of this example.

Tests 8 and 9 demonstrate that the prompt rules around scope and
ambiguity take effect without any tool call, which is the desired
behaviour.

## A note on scope and dependencies

This example does not modify any code under `mcp_server/`, does not
change your CI configuration, and does not add any new top-level
dependencies to your project. All extra packages live in
`examples/agno-bindu/requirements.txt` and are strictly opt-in.

The intent is to make it easy for downstream users to extend your MCP
server into a fully autonomous agent without forking your repository.
If at any point the maintainers would prefer a different structure (for
example, moving the example to its own repository), the Bindu team is
happy to accommodate.

## About the contributing team

Bindu (https://github.com/GetBindu/Bindu) is a framework for building
autonomous AI agents as microservices, each one identified by a
Decentralized Identifier, each one able to talk to other agents over
the Agent-to-Agent protocol. We are using Bindu to build a **compliance
operating system for small and medium businesses** — a system in which
jurisdiction-specific agents (tax, labour, data protection, contract
review, and so on) answer questions and draft documents on a company's
behalf, grounded in primary sources.

The Lex Taiwan agent in this directory is the first jurisdiction-specific
agent in our showcase, and this pull request is the result of
integrating your MCP server into our stack. We will be linking back to
your repository from the Bindu documentation, the Bindu examples
directory, and any public material in which Lex Taiwan appears, so that
anyone who discovers the agent through Bindu can also discover the work
you have published here.

Thank you for open-sourcing this server. If there is anything we can do
to make this integration more useful to your project — additional
documentation, alternative example structures, or upstream contributions
to `mcp_server/` itself — we would be glad to help.
